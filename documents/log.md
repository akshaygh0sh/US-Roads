## What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
Week 1: Our primary goal was reading csv file and constuct graph. We were able to read csv file in and implement RoadGraph class consturctor. We made two different structs called Edge and RoadNode. 

## What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week

Week 1: Since this week was pretty light workload, read data file in and construct RoadGraph, we did together using one laptop. All group members downloaded required packages/libraries. 

## What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals

Week 1: We encountered problem when we tried to download some packages for reading data in as csv file. The problem was cmake package was too old. However, we solved this problem by using docker container. 

## What you plan to accomplish next week

Week 2 Goal: Find shortest path between two nodes using travsal.
