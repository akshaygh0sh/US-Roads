## What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
Week 1: Our primary goal was reading csv file and constuct graph. We were able to read csv file in and implement RoadGraph class consturctor. We made two different structs called Edge and RoadNode. 

Week 2: Our goal is to find shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. To be honest, everything went smoothly. Since we are farmiliar with Dijkstra's algorithm, we were able to accomplish successfully. When we run it, we get expected output. 

## What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week

Week 1: Since this week was pretty light workload, read data file in and construct RoadGraph, we did together using one laptop. All group members downloaded required packages/libraries. 

Week 2: Similiar to last week, this week workload is pretty light and there was not much thing to divide work. We did together using one laptop. All group members discussed and actively participated to implement shortestPath function. 

## What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals

Week 1: We encountered problem when we tried to download some packages for reading data in as csv file. The problem was cmake package was too old. However, we solved this problem by using docker container. 

Week 2: The only problems we had were with a merge conflict because we failed to pull the feedback change. After implementing Dijkstra's, we realized we forgot to handle the case where the start and end nodes are disjoint, that was an easy change. As it is right now, we think everything works properly.

## What you plan to accomplish next week

Week 2 Goal: Find shortest path between two nodes using travsal.

Week 3 Goal: Implement the approximate traveling salesman algorithm
