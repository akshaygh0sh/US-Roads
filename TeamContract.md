### Communication

* The primary form of communication for our group will be through text or Discord. We expect that any concerns voiced through any of these channels will be addressed as soon as possible (provided the question was asked at a decent time (9:00 a.m. - 11 p.m.))

* It is expected that each group member respond in a timely fashion (within 3-5 hours) to any comment regarding them, or at least make a note that they will get back to the issue/error that they were mentioned in

* We will treat each other with respect and check in with other group members during work allocation/assignment to see if they have any issues with the task they were assigned or have any broad concerns with what they have to do

### Collaboration 

* As for the work during the final project itself, we will have a much better idea as to what the individual workload will look like once we actually get started on the project itself, but we will always check in with each other before finalizing the work assignments

* It is also encouraged that if anyone has an issue with their work assignment or thinks that they may not be able to finish their portion of the work in time that communicate this to the rest of the group

* As we work through the project, we expect to have rough deadlines that act as informal checkpoints; it is expected that these deadlines are met, but if we realize that a specific component of the project will take much more time than expected, then we can adjust these or (preferably not) fail to meet these deadlines

### Conflict Resolution

* If any conflicts/disagreements arise during our development of our final project, we will try to hold a group meeting to address these concerns. We are all mature and are sure we can make compromises to resolve any potential disagreements
