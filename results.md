# The output and correctness of each algorithm

- Summarize algorithms 
    - 
    Overall, we used 3 different algorithms. Dijkstra's algorithm, approximate traveling salesman algorithm, and A* algorithm. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path between two nodes. We implemented traveling salesmen algorithm by finding the shortest path between each node in vector of nodes to compute the travelling salesman path between. Then, we found each permutation of the salesman path and returned the optimal path between each vertices. We used A* algorithm to improve the run time of our shortest path algorithm.

- Describe what tests we performed
    - Not only did general C++ unit testing using test and catch, we also compared performance of each algorithms using Benchmark. 


# The answer to your leading question

- How did we answer leading question? 
    --
    Our leading question was "What is the most efficient way to traverse the United States by road? Given a starting and ending intersection, find the shortest route between the two nodes. Additionally, what is an efficient route for visiting several nodes in any order?" NOT DONE YET 
- What did we discover? 
    -- 
    We discover NOT DONE YET 
- If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team

    OUR PROJECT WAS UNTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL BUT I JUST ADDED BC THIS IS PART OF PROMPT
