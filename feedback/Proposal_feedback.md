# Grade: Sophisticated (100%)

Looks great! The deliverables are clear, the algorithm looks good and the plan looks challenging but doable with your group size. Thinking about heuristics is a good start and I'd definitely explore around on the internet on practical things to try out since travelling salesman is a lot.

Looking forward to your work!
